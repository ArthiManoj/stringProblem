Goals of the Project:

Given a String and a Character, remove all instances of the Character in the String

Solve this two ways:
1. Iterate through the String, one character at a time
2. Find a method in the String class that can solve this in one line

Write methods for each solution.

Afterwards, write a TestNG or JUnit class for each solution which tests these methods.
Include both positive and negative cases for validations.

Tools Used:

Java: Programming language
JUnit: Unit testing framework for java
Git: To save and manage test scripts on version updates and changes.
Maven: Build automation tool primarily used for java projects.It describes how software is built and its dependencies.
JUnit SureFire: Used to generate test reports where team members can act accordingly.
Eclipse IDE for developing the Framework

Test Cases:

Input values: 

String : Javaxisxaxprogrammingxlanguage
Character : x

Expected result: Java is a programming language

1. Test the function : iterate(String stringInput, Character charInput) from class name : StringManipulaion.java
   The function which iterate through the String, one character at a time
   - pass the string and the character as a input
   - Assert if the expected value and output value from the function matches
   
2. Test the function : stringFunction(String stringInput, Character charInput) from class name : StringManipulaion.java
   The function which uses a method from String class that can solve this in one line
   - pass the string and the character as a input
   - Assert if the expected value and output value from the function matches
   
 3. Negative test scenario  
   - pass the string and a character as 'z'
   - Assert if the expected value and output value from the function match
